    <I>fxp</I> is a validating XML parser. It reads an XML document
    and reports all well-formedness errors, validity errors and other 
    errors in that document. It can also warn about interoperability 
    features and other issues mentioned in the XML recommendation.
    <P>
    The typical invocation of <I>fxp</I> is 
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>fxp [option ...] [infile]</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    If <SAMP>infile</SAMP> is given, <I>fxp</I> reads its input document
    from that file, otherwise from standard input.

    <H4><A NAME=EXA-ERR>Controlling Error Printing</A></H4>
    By default <I>fxp</I> reports all errors and warnings to the standard error.
    This can be controlled by options:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	All messages can be redirected to a file named <SAMP>errfile</SAMP> via the
	option <SAMP>--error-output=errfile</SAMP> or, for short, <SAMP>-e&nbsp;errfile</SAMP>.
      <LI>
	All messages can be suppressed by supplying the <SAMP>--silent</SAMP>
	option, or <SAMP>-s</SAMP> for short. 
      <LI>
	By default, the parser tries avoid printing an error that has already been 
	printed earlier. E.g., if an attribute is misspelled in the attribute list 
	declaration, there will be an undeclared-attribute error ech time this
	attribute is actually specified for an element. Printing of all but the 
	first of these errors is suppressed. In order to make <I>fxp</I> print this
	kind of duplicate error messages, use the <SAMP>--few-errors=no</SAMP> option.
    </UL>

    <H4><A NAME=EXA-VAL>Validating and Non-Validating Mode</A></H4>
    By default <I>fxp</I> is a validating parser, but it can be run in 
    non-validating mode with the <SAMP>--validate=no</SAMP> or, for short,
    <SAMP>-nv</SAMP> option. 
    This has the following effects:
    <UL>
      <LI>only the internal subset of the DTD is parsed and checked for 
	well-formedness; 
      <LI>the external subset and all references to external parameter entities 
	are ignored;
      <LI>declarations in the internal subset are processed only upto the first  
	reference to an external parameter entity;
      <LI>validity constraints are not verified;
      <LI>no referenced parameter entities are included;
      <LI>by default, no external parsed general entities are included; 
	this can be changed with the <SAMP>--include-external</SAMP> option;
      <LI>all attributes for which no declaration has been processed are assumed 
	to be declared <SAMP>CDATA</SAMP> with default value <SAMP>#IMPLIED</SAMP>;
    </UL>
    For instance, consider an example document 
    <A HREF="Examples/exa-1.xml"><SAMP>exa-1.xml</SAMP></A>, referencing files 
    <A HREF="Examples/exa-1.ext"><SAMP>exa-1.ext</SAMP></A>, 
    <A HREF="Examples/ext.elem"><SAMP>ext.elem</SAMP></A> and 
    <A HREF="Examples/ext.decl"><SAMP>ext.decl</SAMP></A>.
    Running 
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>fxp exa-1.xml</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE> 
    reports the following errors:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[exa-1.xml:17.11] Error: Attribute 'num' has the value 'a' but was declared with
    a fixed default value of '0'.
[exa-1.xml:18.12] Error: ID name 'id1' already occurred as an attribute value.
[exa-1.xml:19.0] Error: Element type 'a' not allowed at this point in the 
    content of element 'a'.
[ext.elem:1.11] Error: Attribute 'num' has the value '1' but was declared with a
    fixed default value of '0'.
[ext.elem:1.15] Error: Element 'a' was ended by an end-tag for 'b'.
[exa-1.xml:20.7] Error: Attribute 'nmu' was not declared for element type 'b'.
[exa-1.xml:20.12] Error: No value was specified for required attribute 'num'.
[exa-1.xml:20.12] Error: The end-tag for element 'b' with declared EMPTY content
    must follow immediately after its start-tag.</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    whereas the non-validating mode 
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>fxp -nv exa-1.xml</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    does not find any errors. 
    Note that the error at <SAMP>[ext.elem:1.15]</SAMP> is a well-formedness
    error but is not reported since the external entity reference <SAMP>&amp;ext;</SAMP>
    in not included. But if we make the parser include external parsed entities:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>fxp -nv --include-external exa-1.xml</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    then the error is reported:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[ext.elem:1.15] Error: Element 'a' was ended by an end-tag for 'b'.</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H4><A NAME=EXA-COMP>Compatibility Modes</A></H4>
    Some features in XML have only been included for compatibility with SGML.
    These include:
    <UL>
      <LI>the string (<SAMP>]]&gt;</SAMP>) may not appear literally in content;
      <LI>a comment may not contain a double-hyphen (<SAMP>--</SAMP>);
      <LI>content models must be unambiguous.
    </UL>
    By default <I>fxp</I> checks for compatibility and prints errors in case 
    it is not obeyed. This can be changed with the <SAMP>--compatibility=no</SAMP>
    or, for short, <SAMP>-nc</SAMP> option. 
    <P>
      In non-compatibility mode, however, the parser must handle ambiguous 
      content models. This implies generation of a deterministic finite state
      machine (DFA), which may in the worst case have size exponential in the
      size of the content model. In order to avoid too high space usage, 
      <I>fxp</I> imposes a limit on the size of the generated DFA. If this limit
      is exceeded, a warning is printed and the content model is approximated by 
      <SAMP>(e<SUB>1</SUB>|...|e<SUB>n</SUB>)*</SAMP>,
      where <SAMP>e<SUB>1</SUB></SAMP>, ..., <SAMP>e<SUB>n</SUB></SAMP> are 
      all element types occurring in the original model. The new content model
      is less restrictive but allows for a small DFA. The limit defaults to 256
      and can be set by the <SAMP>--dfa-max-size</SAMP> option, and the warning 
      can be suppressed with the <SAMP>--dfa-warn-size=no</SAMP> option.
    <P>
      For instance, consider the document 
      <A HREF="Examples/exa-2.xml"><SAMP>exa-2.xml</SAMP></A>. Note that the
      content model for element <SAMP>a</SAMP> is ambiguous, and its DFA needs
      at least 257 states. Running <I>fxp</I> in compatibility mode produces 
      the following errors:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[exa-2.xml:4.65] Error: Content model is ambiguous: conflict between the 1st and
    the 2nd occurrence of element 'b'. Using an approximation instead.
[exa-2.xml:10.26] Error: '--' is not allowed in a comment.
[exa-2.xml:13.26] Error: Character '>' must be escaped for compatibility.</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    Note that the empty element tag for <SAMP>a</SAMP> is not an error since
    <SAMP>a</SAMP>'s content model was approximated. Running in non-compatibility
    mode:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>fxp -nc exa-1.xml</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    suppressed these errors, but reports the following instead:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[exa-2.xml:4.65] Warning: The finite state machine for the content model of 
    element type 'a' would have more than the maximal allowed number of 256 
    states. Using an approximation instead.</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    This warning can be suppressed by invoking <I>fxp</I> like this:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>fxp -nc --dfa-warn-size=no exa-1.xml</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    But still the invalidity of the empty-element tag for <SAMP>a</SAMP> is
    not detected. In order to achieve this, we can raise the limit for the
    DFA's size:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>fxp -nc --dfa-max-size=257 exa-1.xml</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    Now element <SAMP>a</SAMP>'s content can be validated and the error is
    reported:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[exa-2.xml:12.0] Error: Empty-element tag for element type 'a' whose content 
    model requires non-empty content.</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H4><A NAME=EXA-INTER>Interoperability Modes</A></H4>
    XML also includes some interoperability recommendations in to allow existing
    SGML software to process XML documents. These recommendations are 
    non-binding and therefore not checked for by default. The 
    <SAMP>--interoperability</SAMP> or, for short, <SAMP>-i</SAMP> option makes
    <I>fxp</I> run in interoperability-mode, which enables checking for these
    features. Some of these features can additionally be controlled by individual
    options.
    The following table lists the features supported by <I>fxp</I>, together 
    with the option (if any) that enables or disables them, and whether they
    are enabled by default if <SAMP>--interoperability</SAMP> is supplied:

	<SAMP>--warn-mult-decl[=arg]</SAMP>
      <DD> 
	Turns on or off a warning if something is declared multiple times. 
	<SAMP>arg</SAMP> specifies which declarations this applies to, and must be one of 
	the following: 
	<UL>
	  <LI>A comma-separated list <SAMP>key<SUB>1</SUB>[,key<SUB>2</SUB> ...]</SAMP>, 
	    where each key is one out of:
	    <UL>
	      <LI><SAMP>att</SAMP> 
		for multiple definitions of an attribute for the same element;
	      <LI><SAMP>attlist</SAMP> 
		for multiple attribute list declaration for an element;

      <DT>
	<SAMP>--include-external[=(yes|no)]</SAMP>
      <DD> 
	Specifies whether external parsed entity references are included in content or not.
	Has no effect in validating mode (then all references are included).
	If no argument is given, <SAMP>yes</SAMP> is assumed.

      <DT>
	<SAMP>--dfa-initial-size=n</SAMP>
      <DD> 
	The transition table of a finite state machine grows dynamically during its
	creation, i.e., if the table's size is exceeded, it is recreated with double
	size. This option sets the initial size of the transition table to the next 
	power of 2 larger or equal to <SAMP>n</SAMP>. 
	Default is <SAMP>16</SAMP>.
      <DT>
	<SAMP>--dfa-initial-width=n</SAMP>
      <DD> 
	Same as <SAMP>--dfa-initial-size=2<SUP>n</SUP></SAMP>.
      <DT>
	<SAMP>--dfa-max-size=n</SAMP>
      <DD> 
	For ambiguous content models the parser generates a deterministic finite 
	state machine (DFA), which may in the worst case have size exponential in the
	size of the content model. This option specifies a threshold for the 
	number of admissible states of the DFA. If it is exceeded, the content
	model is approximated by the content model 
	<SAMP>(e<SUB>1</SUB>|...|e<SUB>n</SUB>)*</SAMP>,
	where <SAMP>e<SUB>1</SUB></SAMP>, ..., <SAMP>e<SUB>n</SUB></SAMP> are 
	all element types occurring in the original model.
	Default is <SAMP>256</SAMP>.
      <DT>
	<SAMP>--dfa-warn-size[=(yes|no)]</SAMP>
      <DD> 
	Turns on or off a warning if the maximal number of states specified by
	<SAMP>--dfa-max-size</SAMP> is exceeded by the DFA construction for a
	content model.
	If no argument is given, <SAMP>yes</SAMP> is assumed. 
	Default is <SAMP>yes</SAMP>.
